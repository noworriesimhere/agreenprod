According to Florida law, ‘talent agency’ means any person who, for compensation, engages in the occupation or business of procuring or attempting to procure engagements for an artist. If you would like to engage with any of these artists for personal appearances, please contact the artist directly. AGreen Production represents the efforts of artists as ‘deliverables’, not as ‘artist for hire’.  Engagement” means any employment or placement of an artist, where the artist performs in his or her artistic capacity. However, the term “engagement” shall not apply to procuring opera, music, theater, or dance engagements for any organization defined in s. 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code or any nonprofit Florida arts organization that has received a grant from the Division of Cultural Affairs of the Department of State or has participated in the state touring program of the Division of Cultural Affairs.
